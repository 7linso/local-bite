# local-bite (frontend)

simple recipe app to learn vue

## Installation

this is vue3 project so it needs some setup

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
extremely complicated

## desc

i’m learning vue cause it looks clean, friendly, and kinda cute (jojo-fan is here, if u know u know)

local-bite lets people share how they cook dishes where they live.
everyone eats. everyone cooks differently. why keep great recipes secret?
show how you make your favs in your area and discover how others do it, too.
(hot take: pineapple on pizza is a big no-no)

# tech stack
- vue 3 (composition api) + vite
- pinia (state) + vue router
- tailwind css + daisyui
- maptiler i guess
- api... express? (update: currently working on backend, express + mongo)
